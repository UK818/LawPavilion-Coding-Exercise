Search for Github users using GitHub search API


Thought Process:
- Used Model View View-Model (MVVM) design architecture so my code will be loosely coupled
  and that helps in writing clean and maintainable code that is easy to test.
- Adhered to SOLID Principles
- created UI programmatically
- created model for data to be received from API
- Made network call using URLSession
- cached images using KingFisher
- validated search input
